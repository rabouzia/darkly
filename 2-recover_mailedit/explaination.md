# Email Recovery Function Exploit

## Vulnerability Description
This exploit demonstrates a **Parameter Tampering** vulnerability in the password recovery functionality where the email address can be manipulated to redirect password reset links to unauthorized recipients.

## Attack Methodology

### Reconnaissance
- Identify the password recovery form
- Analyze the email parameter handling
- Determine the request structure and parameters

### Exploitation Steps
1. **Access the password recovery page** and initiate a password reset
2. **Intercept the HTTP request** using browser developer tools or proxy
3. **Modify the email parameter** to an attacker-controlled email address
4. **Submit the manipulated request** to redirect the reset link
5. **Access the password reset link** sent to the attacker's email

### Technical Details
- **Vulnerability Type**: Parameter Tampering / Email Hijacking
- **Attack Vector**: HTTP Request Manipulation
- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to password reset functionality
- **Difficulty Level**: Low

## Root Cause Analysis
The application fails to validate email ownership and allows arbitrary email addresses to be used in password recovery requests, enabling email hijacking attacks.

## Mitigation Strategies

### Immediate Fixes
1. **Implement email verification** before allowing password resets
2. **Add rate limiting** to prevent brute force attacks
3. **Use secure tokens** with expiration for reset links
4. **Implement proper session management**

### Long-term Security Measures
1. **Multi-factor authentication** for sensitive operations
2. **Email verification workflows** with confirmation steps
3. **Audit logging** for all password recovery attempts
4. **Security monitoring** for unusual patterns

## Security Best Practices
- Always verify email ownership before password resets
- Implement rate limiting on recovery endpoints
- Use time-limited, secure tokens for reset links
- Log all password recovery attempts
- Implement proper error handling without information disclosure

## Flag
The exploit successfully manipulates the email parameter in the password recovery function to obtain the flag.

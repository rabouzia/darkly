# SQL Injection in Image Gallery Exploit

## Vulnerability Description
This exploit demonstrates a **SQL Injection** vulnerability in an image gallery functionality where malicious SQL code is injected through user input, allowing unauthorized database access and data extraction from image-related tables.

## Attack Methodology

### Reconnaissance
- Identify the image gallery functionality and its database interactions
- Analyze the application's image query mechanisms
- Determine the database structure for image-related tables
- Map the application's image handling logic

### Exploitation Steps
1. **Identify the vulnerable image gallery endpoint** that interacts with the database
2. **Analyze the application's response** to understand the database structure
3. **Construct SQL injection payload** using UNION-based attack
4. **Target image-related tables** to extract sensitive data
5. **Execute the payload**: `1 or 1=1 UNION select url, comment from list_images`

### Technical Details
- **Vulnerability Type**: SQL Injection
- **Attack Vector**: UNION-based SQL Injection
- **Payload**: `1 or 1=1 UNION select url, comment from list_images`
- **Target Tables**: `list_images` table with `url` and `comment` columns
- **Impact**: Unauthorized database access and image metadata extraction
- **Difficulty Level**: High

## Root Cause Analysis
The application fails to use prepared statements or proper input validation for image gallery queries, allowing malicious SQL code to be executed directly in database queries.

## Mitigation Strategies

### Immediate Fixes
1. **Use prepared statements** to separate data from SQL code
2. **Implement proper input validation** and sanitization
3. **Use parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection
4. **Implement proper error handling** without information disclosure

### Long-term Security Measures
1. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** with SQL injection protection
2. **Regular security audits** of database interactions
3. **Static code analysis** to identify vulnerable patterns
4. **Security testing** including automated SQL injection detection

## Security Best Practices
- Always use prepared statements or parameterized queries
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Use least privilege database accounts
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing
- Implement proper error handling without information disclosure

## SQL Injection Prevention
- Use prepared statements (prepared statements)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Parameterized queries
- Database user with minimal privileges
- Regular security testing and code reviews

## Flag
The exploit successfully extracts sensitive data from the image gallery database through SQL injection to obtain the flag: `f2a29020ef3132e01dd61df97fd33ec8d7fcd1388cc9601e7db691d17d4d6188`
